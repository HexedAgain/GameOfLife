# Game Of Life Simulator
A very simple implementation of John Conway's Game Of Life.

## To Use
Download and build the application (obviously), then ...
Set number of rows and columns, update the grid, toggle cell liveness manually and then hit the play button

# Near Future Plans
- Add ability to randomise cell liveness as opposed to manually updating the grid
- Display the duration of the previous game (number of steps)

# Long In The Future Plans ...
- Add ability to drag over tiles, and from this selection choose from a known library of configurations (like glider etc ...)
